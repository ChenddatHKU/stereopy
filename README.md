## **Stereopy**: Spatial transcriptomics analysis in Python

[Installation](https://stereopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/General/Installation.html) - [Quick start](https://stereopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorials/quick_start.html) - [Documentation](https://stereopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - [API](https://stereopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html)

stereopy is a tool for the analysis and visualization of spatial transcriptomics data, such as stereo-seq data.
It provides a series of analysis of spatial omics, and will be added to the tissue image related analysis later.
Maybe the performance of this version is not optimal, and we will improve performance and calculation efficiency, and can support a large number of analyses in the future.
